A programm is written to solve the skyscapers game, a logical game about the placements of the houses.
In this game you need to place the houses of different heights on the game board, so that the number
of visible houses form a sertain position was equal to the number in the hint. The program checks the 
status of the board and returns boolean value according to its (un)compliance with the rules.
